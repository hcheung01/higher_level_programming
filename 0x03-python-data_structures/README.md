## More Info for Python programs
* All Python files is PEP 8(version 1.7) formatted
* Python Scripts - first line of every file is exactly be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3 and executable

## More Info for C programs
* All C files is formatted Betty style and checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* All C header files is guarded
* Compiled using this command "gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic"
