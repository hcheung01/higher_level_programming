---
## Description

This project in the High Level Programming series is about:
* What are the most common methods of sets and how to use them
* When to use sets versus lists
* How to iterate into a set
* What are dictionary and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate into a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What is map, reduce and map functions
